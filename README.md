## Getting Started

The goal of our app is to provide a platform to buy and sell textbooks between members of the Hofstra community. It was specifically designed to be easy to use and easy to understand. 

## Features
- Searchable Textbooks
- Secure Login System 
- Wishlist
- Seller's Interface
- Account Modifiers
- Dark Mode
- Immersive GUI

## Summary of Tools
  - [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) was used to provide our entire backend. Since Firebase functions as a backend as a service we were able to utilze it for our database, authentication, encryption and testing.

  - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) was used to create our app. We chose Flutter because it allowed for multi-platform development as well as an easy and comprehensive system to build robust features into our app. 
  
 - [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) was used to retrieve textbook information based off of the Title, ISBN and Authors.
 
 - [Open Library Covers](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers) was used to retrieve cover images of textbooks that we reference within our app.
